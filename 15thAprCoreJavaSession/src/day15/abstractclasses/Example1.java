	 * 		- method 
	 * 			static/non-static--> declaration + body
	 * 			abstract method  --> declaration with abstract keyword without body
	 * when this class is getting inherited by any child class dn there will be a contract between abstract class and child class
	 * that contract is, child class has to	override all the abstract method of abstract class otherwise child class becomes abstract class	
	 * 
	 * any class having even single abstract method should be declared as abstract, 
	 * where as there is no rule for abstract class to have abstract method
